Description: Implements methods to estimate conditional outcome means in 
    settings with missingness-not-at-random and incomplete auxiliary variables. 
    Specifically, this package implements the marginalization over incomplete
    auxiliaries (MIA) method. 
    The package supports continuous and binary outcomes, and 
    supports auxiliary variables that are normal, binary, and categorical.
